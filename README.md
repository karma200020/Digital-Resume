# ABOUT PROJECT
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. Here you can explore my profile in a much more interactive way. The website is built to be themed around Ubuntu default theme and I have tried to make as realistic as possible. Please have a look at it and do not forget to leave a comment, suggestion, or a job offer :) ( if you like my work ) in the contact section.
